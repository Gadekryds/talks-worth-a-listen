1. What are the documentation for
 
1.1Internal use:
 
Write documentation while its still fresh
 
Things that troubled you during implementation....
 
Things that arent clear / straight forward - specific implementation rules
 
 
 
1.2 external use (users and consumers)
 
Overall description
Usescases
 
Quirks, issues, and things to consider while using the functionality
 
Examples - simple and complex to enable the users to use your services
 
 
2. Documentation
 
Have a general guideline on how to write documentation and where its placed.
 
Create a table of contents:
Meaningfull titles & headers 
Should be structured as microservices each documentation having a solely responsibility, if several usecases are linked then create a link between documentation
 
Use colours to highlight stuff (yellow, green, red) Pops in the eyes
 
 
2.1 docs in databases such as confluence
 
 
2.2 docs as code
Markdown - can still use tables of contents, colours
Plain text
platform agnostic - one size fits all
 
No need to leave IDE..
 
Can be implemented in review phase (check if documentation is made, check for changes in documentation upon merges etc).
